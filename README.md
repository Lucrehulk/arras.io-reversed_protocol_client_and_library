# arras.io-reversed-protocol-client-and-library
I AM PUBLICLY RELEASING THIS DUE TO THE POOR STATE ARRAS IS IN. THIS WAS A SPECIAL CLIENT OF MINE WITH SPECIAL CAPABILITIES REGARDING THE HANDLING OF THE ARRAS.IO PROTOCOL.
I spent some time writing up a "reverse_engineering" folder, which contains a ton of explanations and data on the special code I've created for this game. My hope is that, by releasing this and providing info, skilled coders who want to work on Arras still can use this as a resource. I never fully completed everything and this client is missing some stuff, but it has almost everything of importance. It is a great base to work with, and really does have a ton of useful stuff. Seeing as I have virtually quit this game, I didn't want this code to go to waste.

Old readme stuff below.

A custom arras.io client of mine with a ton of neat features--included fully decoded packets and parsing for them.

Client contains functionality for -
```
Parsing critical incoming packets (full access to things like room, entities, broadcast, mockup data, & more).
Logging and modifying incoming and outgoing packets.
Writing/constructing custom outgoing packets.
& more.
```
