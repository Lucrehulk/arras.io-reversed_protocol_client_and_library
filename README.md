# arras.io-protocol-hooked-custom-client
Publicly releasing this project after the poor state this game has come to. This is a client with multiple features regarding work of the reverse engineering of arras.
I've also added a "my_work" folder, which includes many of the special segments of code, utilities, and explanations I wrote to do these special functions that the client does--all organized into one neat place so someone who wants to utilize these utilites can easily find them and do so.

A custom arras.io client of mine with a ton of neat features--included fully decoded packets and parsing for them.

Client contains functionality for -
```
Parsing critical incoming packets (full access to things like room, entities, broadcast, mockup data, & more).
Logging and modifying incoming and outgoing packets.
Writing/constructing custom outgoing packets.
& more.
```
