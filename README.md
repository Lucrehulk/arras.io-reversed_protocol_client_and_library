# arras.io-protocol-hooked-custom-client
A custom arras.io client of mine with a ton of neat features--included fully decoded packets and parsing for them.

Client contains functionality for -
```
Parsing critical incoming packets "u"pdate, "b"roadcast, "R"oom, "M"ockups (names), "P"layer tab data.
Logging and modifying incoming and outgoing packets.
Writing/constructing custom outgoing packets.
