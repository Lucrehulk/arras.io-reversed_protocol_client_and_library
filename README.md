# arras.io-protocol-hooked-custom-client
A custom arras.io client of mine with a ton of neat features--included fully decoded packets and parsing for them.

Client contains functionality for -
```
Parsing critical incoming packets (full access to things like room, entities, broadcast, mockup data, & more).
Logging and modifying incoming and outgoing packets.
Writing/constructing custom outgoing packets.
& more.
```
