# arras.io-protocol-hooked-custom-client
A custom arras.io client of mine with a ton of neat features--included fully decoded packets and parsing for them.

Client contains functionality for -
```
Parsing critical incoming packets "u"pdate, "b"roadcast, "R"oom, "M"ockups (names only, rest of data wasn't useful enough for me to take time to reverse), "P"layer tab data all have complete parsers
Logging and modifying incoming and outgoing packets.
Writing/constructing custom outgoing packets.
& More
```
